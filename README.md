# Cat Detection with Flask and OpenCV

This project sets up a simple web application using Flask to display a live webcam feed with cat face detection using OpenCV. The application is designed to run on Python 3.8 and utilizes a Haar Cascade classifier to detect cat faces in real-time. Future work includes connecting the application to an Arduino for additional functionalities.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python modules installed:

- Flask
- OpenCV (cv2)
- PySerial

You can install these modules using pip:

```sh
pip install Flask opencv-python pyserial
